There are basic data types built into Python that are frequently used, and there are many others that are more obscure. Python isn't as strict with specifying data types as some other programming languages, but in some cases--especially when dealing with data--we'll want to know how to use them. The ones we will be dealing with include:\n",
    "- <b><u>Integers</u></b> - a whole number (no decimal point).\n",
    "- <b><u>Floats</u></b> - a.k.a. floating point number. It is a data type that represents real numbers (has decimal points).\n",
    "- <b><u>Booleans</u></b> - a data type that can only have one of two values: True or False. We use booleans to control the flow of our code.\n",
    "- <b><u>String</u></b> - a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are what we refer to as <b><u>data structures</u></b> and are ways of storing variables and data in logical and organized ways. There are many more than what are listed below, but this is mainly what we will use in data analysis:\n",

Variables can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they can't start with a number and they can't contain spaces or special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc. Python has a few reserved words that we cannot use for variable names like \"if\", \"else\", \"for\", \"while\", \"import\", \"def\", \"class\", etc. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful so code can be easily read and understood, not just by others but by yourself when you come back to it. There are three different \"cases\" for variable names that are commonly used in coding and are considered standards:\n",
    "- <b><u>Snake Case (snake_case)</u></b> - names like <i>my_variable</i> or <i>num_1</i> that are all lowercase with underscores between words.\n",
    "- <b><u>Camel Case (camelCase)</u></b> - names like <i>myVariable</i> or <i>num1</i> that have the first word lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word capitzlied.\n",

    "We have the airport counts now, so all we need to do is figure out the potential profits based on the number of airports we remove from our network and then graph the results. We will want to remove the airport with the least amount of trips associated with it first, which is why we sorted the values in the last step we did. At the very beginning back in section 0.3 we defined some of our constants like PROFIT_PER_TRIP at 10000 and FEE_PER_AIRPORT at 20000. We found N_TRIPS to be 67663 and, while we haven't set it yet, we found the unique number of airports to be 3425. All these numbers we will use to calculate the profits and get the key value pairs we will need to make sense of the data and visualize it. We can get these numbers using a for loop, some more boolean arrays, our friend <b><u>itterrows()</u></b>, and some new methods in <b><u>max()</u></b> and <b><u>idmax()</u></b>.\n",

However, each time we remove an airport, we need to get rid of any instance of it from our log of trips, thereby getting a lower value than N_TRIPS and N_AIRPORTS each time we itterate. We will need to keep track of our airports remaining and our trips remaining. Let's start by just declaring those variables below."

    "    - <b><u>String</u></b>: a sequence of characters.\n",
    "- <b><u>Casting</u></b>: the process of converting a variable from one data type to another\n",
    "- <b><u>Data Structures</u></b>: a specialized format or framework for organizing and storing data in a computer's memory for efficient and easy access and manipulation. They are designed in a way as to maintain relationships between variables or values.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Lists</u></b>: a default structure in Python that can hold multiple elements/variables of different types.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Arrays</u></b>: an array is not native to the Python library, but are common programming data structures. They are practically identical to lists, though the conceptual difference between them is that an array consists of only one data type while a list can have many.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Tables</u></b>: a two-dimensional array, or a list of lists. Typically imply structured data.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Dataframe</u></b>: a 2-dimensional labeled data structure in the Pandas library with columns of potentially different types.\n",
    "- <b><u>Naming Conventions</u></b>: a set of rules and guidelines for naming identifiers such as variables, functions, constants, and other elements within a program. Naming conventions help improve code readability, maintainability, and consistency by providing a standardized way of naming elements.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Snake Case</u></b>: words are separated by underscores. Examples: *my_varaible*, *num_1*, *really_cool_variable*.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Camel Case</u></b>: words are joined together without spaces, with each word after the first word beginning with a capital letter. Examples: *myVariable*, *num1*, *reallyCoolVariable*.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Pascal Case</u></b>: words are joined together without spaces, every word beginning with a capital letter. Examples: *MyVariable*, *Num1*, *ReallyCoolVariable*.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Constant Variables</u></b>: words are separated by underscores, all letters are capitalized. Designates variables whose values are not supposed to change, or are constant. Examples: *CONSTANT_VARIABLE*, *MY_VARIABLE*, or *NUM_1*.\n",
    "\n",

    "- <b><u>Logical Operators</u></b>: symbols or terms that are used in conditions to show how something is being evaluated. Examples include:\n",
    "    - \\> (greater than), \n",
    "    - < (less than), \n",
    "    - != (not equal), \n",
    "    - \\>= (greater than or equal to), \n",

    "    - and (keyword that combines two conditions and only returns true if both conditions are true on their own),\n",
    "    - or (keyword that combines two conditions and will return true if at least one condition is true on its own),\n",
    "    - not (keyword that reverses the truth value of a condition),\n",
    "    - in (keyword to check if a value is contained in some data structure or string).\n",
    "- <b><u>Assignment Operator (=)</u></b>: used to assign values to variables. While not common in Python because of its built-in protections, one common programming error is to use the assignment operator instead of a logical/comparison operator, which will redefine the value of the variable and always result in a true condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 0.5 - Functions\n",
    "- <b><u>Functions</u></b>: an isolated and reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It accepts zero to many input arguments, performs operations based on those inputs, and can optionally return a result.\n",
    "- <b><u>Methods</u></b>: functions that are specific to certain classes or libraries, typically associated with variables and perform operations on the data contained within those variable objects.\n",
    "- <b><u>Arguments</u></b>: values passed to a function/method that allow it to perform the operations based on the use's preferences and specifications.\n",
    "- <b><u>Scope</u></b>: defines the lifetime and visibility of a piece of code, including variables, functions, and methods.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Global</u></b>: a level of scope that implies visibility everywhere in the code.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Local</u></b>: a level of scope that implies visibility only in a specific section of code. Most commonly this can refer to a variable that is only visible inside a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 0.6 - Loops\n",
    "- <b><u>Loop</u></b>: a strucure used to repeat processes or, generally, blocks of code.\n",
    "    - <b><u>For Loop</u></b>: a repeating structure that is used to iterate over a sequence of elements such as a list, string, or other iterable objects. The loop iterates over each item in the sequence and executes a block of code for each item. Helpful when the number of repeats is calculable.\n",
    "    - <b><u>While Loop</u></b>: a repeating structure that is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to True (boolean value). Helpful when the number of repeats needed are not known or are apt to change.\n",
    "        - <b><u>Infinite Loop</u></b>: an error encountered when a while loop never reaches an end, leading to unexpected results, over-use of computer resources, and code that never ends.\n",
    "    - <b><u>Nested Loops</u></b>: simply, a loop within a loop. Helpful when repeated processes are needed within another repeated process.\n",
    "- <b><u>Boolean Array</u></b>: a.k.a. a boolean mask. It is an array-like data structure containing boolean values (True or False) indicating whether each element in the array it references meets a certain condition.\n",
    "\n",

    "Everything you see here in this file was either created or compiled by Seth Brock, a student in Brigham Young University's Information Systems program, and was made in 2024, made available that April. The idea behind the document was to create something for Global Supply Chain Management students who are interested in data wrangling to get the very basics of Python with Data Wrangling, taught in a context that may be familiar to them. It was hoped that this file was structured in a way that someone with no programming experience at all could follow along, make sense of it, and pick up some useful skills. Content and definitions are not anything official and if the author was not able to think of a cohesive definition, help was gotten from OpenAI's ChatGPT or GitHub's Copilot. The dataset used is a modified version of <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat\">this open-source dataset</a> and its use in this file may not line up with its original intended use. Numbers used in calculations are almost certainly not correct and will not align with real-world numbers (like profit/flight or the cost to rent out space) but were used to teach the principles and get close to relevant GSCM contexts. A special thanks to all of my instructors and professors in the IS program, including Professor Keith, Professor Hilton, Professor Cutler, Professor Wells, Professor Reese, Professor Anderson, and Professor Schuetzler, as well as Professor Hathaway in the GSCM program who helped give me the idea to do this while working as his teaching assisant. Any feedback is greatly appreciated."
