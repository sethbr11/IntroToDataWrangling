StarLift has several airports they fly to and many different routes between airports, and they want to find what the most profitable setup is at different price points and airport fees. They want to find out if they should remove airports and, if so, how many they should remove. Your task is to do an analysis of the trip data provided to find the number of airports they fly to/from, the most used airports, and create a model showing the relationship between potential profits and airports removed."

    "Next, we theorize that even though one airport has more/less trips than another, we don't know how many other airports will be impacted by the removal of the one we intend to remove, and if one airport might have a bigger impact by its removal than another on different airports. Another simulation may be needed to test different methods of airport removal to see if we can get an even higher max profit using some elements of randomness in our process. This next section is just to introduct the idea of random selection even though a Monte Carlo simulation is not intended for such a simple model. Here is a good summary of the methodology: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/monte-carlo-simulation/"
