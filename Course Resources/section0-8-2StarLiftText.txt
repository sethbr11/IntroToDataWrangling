The goal of this analysis was to analyze the company StarLift Airline's structure in airports around the world. They have several airports they rent space from and want to find what the most profitable setup is at different price points and airport fees--specifically if they should remove airports from their network and, if so, how many they should remove. We did an analysis of the trip data provided to find the number of airports, the number of trips each airports is involved in (to find the most used airports), and we created a model showing the relationship between potential profits and airports removed. In this process we found the peak profitability to come at the removal of 2575 airports, increasing our original profits astronomically to $355,960,000 in the measured period from a previously negative value.
