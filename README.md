# Intro to Data Wrangling
This Intro to Data Wrangling course in Python was designed originally for BYU Global Supply Chain Management students who are interested in data wrangling to get the very basics of Python with Data Wrangling, taught in a context that may be familiar to them. It was hoped that this file was structured in a way that someone with no programming experience at all could follow along, make sense of it, and pick up some useful skills. Content and definitions are not anything official and if the author was not able to think of cohesive definitions, help was gotten from OpenAI's ChatGPT or GitHub's Copilot. The dataset used is a modified version of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat">this open-source dataset</a> and its use in this file may not line up with its original intended use. Numbers used in calculations are almost certainly not correct and will not align with real-world numbers (like profit/flight or the cost to rent out space) but were used to teach the principles and get close to relevant GSCM contexts and can easily be replaced with more relevant numbers. A special thanks to all of my instructors and professors in the IS program, including Professor Keith, Professor Hilton, Professor Cutler, Professor Wells, Professor Reese, Professor Anderson, and Professor Schuetzler, as well as Professor Hathaway in the GSCM program who helped give me the idea to do this while working as his teaching assisant. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
